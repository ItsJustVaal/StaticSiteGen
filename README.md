# 🛠️ Static Site Generator

This is a project I'm working on to build a **static site generator from scratch** using Python.

The goal is to create a tool that takes raw content (like plain text or Markdown) and transforms it into a complete, stylized static website. It's not just about building a site — it's about building the tool that builds the site.

## 🚧 Project Overview

This generator will:

- Parse and convert structured text into valid HTML
- Apply HTML templates to wrap content consistently
- Crawl directories to find and process input files
- Output a full set of HTML files ready to deploy

## ✅ Goals

- Deepen my understanding of file I/O, parsing, and templating in Python
- Build a command-line tool for generating static websites
- Learn how static site generators work under the hood
- Deploy the final output to a live URL

## 🌐 Demo

At the end of this project, I'll have:

- A fully functional static site generator
- A generated site deployed live to the internet

## This is part of the Boot.Dev course (not an ad)
